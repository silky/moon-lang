// You probably know very well about JavaScript's callback-hell. What you might
// not know is that it is very related to the problem of expressing monadic
// computations (side-effects, etc.) on functional languages. FP langs solved
// the problem with the `do-notation`. JavaScript solved it with `async/await`.
// The `do-notation` is more powerful (works for any monad), but `async/await`
// has simpler syntax. Moon has the !<> syntax, which combines the best of both.
// 
// Here is how it works: you can prefix any Moon expression with a pipe, `|`.
// That marks the beginning of a "scope". Inside that scope, you're able to use
// the *normal* Moon syntax, except you can annotate any expression with either
// `<F` or `F>`. The first means "execute the function `F` and place the result
// of its callback here". The second means "execute the function `F`, ignore
// the result of its callback, and place the next expression here". And that's
// it! With that, you're able to use async/monadic values like normal values in
// any part of the language's syntax, for any Monad! Cool, isn't it?
//
// Note: this was 96.3% borrowed from Idris's (aka best PL) bang-notation.

runIO(M.parseWith(moonBase, cli));

// The trick for monads is that `ioPutLine` is the requivalent of
// `ioPutLine >>=` on Haskell. Since there is no typeclass system,
// you need to define the binding operation explicitly. Moon hides
// that under the variable name.

// Also note how we need runIO to print/read from the console. Moon
// is pure and couldn't do that natively, so we must "interpret" the
// monadic computation from the outside.
